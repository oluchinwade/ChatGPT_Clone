## Introduction
This is a Django-based application that clones Chat-GPT using the Chat-GPT API. Chat-GPT is a language model that can generate human-like text responses. This project provides a user interface for interacting with Chat-GPT and demonstrates how to integrate the OpenAI API with a Django application.

## Features
- **Chat Interface:** Users can interact with Chat-GPT through a chat-like interface.

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and session management.
- **Customizable Chat Experience:** The chat interface can be customized to suit your application's needs.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work well on different devices and screen sizes.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:
- **Django:** Make sure you have Django installed on your system. You can install it using pip:
  
  ```bash
  pip install Django
- **OpenAI API Key:** You need an API key from OpenAI to access the Chat-GPT API. Get your API key from the OpenAI Developer Portal.
